    <title>AI Alignment doesn&#039;t need more attention</title>

    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/AI-Alignment-doesn't-need-more-attention</guid>
    <description>by Defender We know the correct solution to AI alignment has to be bottom up. We also know that you must answer the question “align to what?”. The final piece that isn’t yet widely accepted as far as I can tell is that you CANNOT align AI without aligning humans as well.</description>

    <title>Scissor Statement is a Scissor Statement?</title>
    <link>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/Scissor-Statement-is-a-Scissor-Statement</link>
    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/Scissor-Statement-is-a-Scissor-Statement</guid>
    <description>I’ve been using the phrase “scissor statement” IRL, and some people can infer what it means, but most stop me and ask “wait, what is a scissor statement?” This strikes me as a useful litmus ...</description>

    <title>The Current Bottleneck to Coordination</title>

    <description>I think it’s theory. There is no “journal of coordination science”. We can’t peer review each other, no shared language exists1. We pretty much figured out most of the theory, but we haven’t peer reviewed each other.</description>

    <title>Why it hurts so much when others point out your flaws</title>

    <description>TODO: explain that it’s about because it calls into question your own awareness of yourself. If you did something rude, AND you weren’t aware it’s rude, then you are NOT in control.</description>

    <title>When to switch to a new paradigm?</title>
    <link>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/When-to-switch-to-a-new-paradigm</link>
    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/When-to-switch-to-a-new-paradigm</guid>
    <description>There is no objective, rational answer to this question. Only switching when a new paradigm makes better predictions means you never develop new paradigms (heliocentrism made WORSE predictions of the motion of planets at the beginning, until accepted &amp; developed) It is unknowable whether a paradigm will bear fruit until you try it.</description>

    <title>Peer Review Goes Both Ways</title>
    <link>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/Peer-Review-Goes-Both-Ways</link>
    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/Peer-Review-Goes-Both-Ways</guid>
    <description>Opt-in to make your peer review public. If you say “this work is amazing, world changing”, there are two possible outcomes: ✅ It really is, and you publicly declaring this helps it spread, and helps you (signals you have foresight/called it early) ❌ It is not, it actually has serious flaws, in which case it STILL helps you (it hurts your reputation, but if your review was genuine, this is important feedback for you to know) This makes people want to be “early to endorse” groundbreaking stuff (first public reviewer is known, first 10 public reviewers etc) Also makes it possible for undergrads (or anyone) to contribute.</description>
