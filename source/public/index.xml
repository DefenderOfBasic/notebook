This is how you change them, or outcompete them (you can‚Äôt claim to be a good person and refuse to learn about your enemies, while they keep winning &amp; the good guys despair) Every human has been part of a memetics study.</description>

    <description> DUDE HOW I DIDNT SEE THIS BEFORE. HOLY SHIT. SO, NODES THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER RIGHT? COOL. SO THIS CREATES A TEMPORAL MYOPIA, WHERE CONNECTED NODES MAY OPTIMIZE FOR FREQUENT COACTIVATION WHICH MIGHT BE HARMFUL FOR THE BROADER NETWORK.</description>
