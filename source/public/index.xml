    <title>When to switch to a new paradigm?</title>
    <link>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/When-to-switch-to-a-new-paradigm</link>

    <description>There is no objective, rational answer to this question. Only switching when a new paradigm makes better predictions means you never develop new paradigms (heliocentrism made WORSE predictions of the motion of planets at the beginning, until accepted &amp; developed) It is unknowable whether a paradigm will bear fruit until you try it.</description>

    <description>Opt-in to make your peer review public. If you say ‚Äúthis work is amazing, world changing‚Äù, there are two possible outcomes: ‚úÖ It really is, and you publicly declaring this helps it spread, and helps you (signals you have foresight/called it early) ‚ùå It is not, it actually has serious flaws, in which case it STILL helps you (it hurts your reputation, but if your review was genuine, this is important feedback for you to know) This makes people want to be ‚Äúearly to endorse‚Äù groundbreaking stuff (first public reviewer is known, first 10 public reviewers etc) Also makes it possible for undergrads (or anyone) to contribute.</description>
