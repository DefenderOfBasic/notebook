    <description> If you really think the other side is evil, you MUST try to predict them. This is how you change them, or outcompete them (you can’) .</description>

    <description> DUDE HOW I DIDNT SEE THIS BEFORE. HOLY SHIT. SO, NODES THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER RIGHT? COOL. SO THIS CREATES A TEMPORAL MYOPIA, WHERE CONNECTED NODES MAY OPTIMIZE FOR FREQUENT COACTIVATION WHICH MIGHT BE HARMFUL FOR THE BROADER NETWORK.</description>

    <description>Scratch notes from “We know how to fix peer review” It’s an alignment problem. We can test this empirically, then publish the results in a journal of coordination science.</description>

    <title>Sabine vs McCulloch</title>
    <link>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/Sabine-vs-McCulloch</link>
    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/Sabine-vs-McCulloch</guid>
    <description>Sabine usually reviews things accurately and with high integrity. In this case she seems to have dismissed with poor reasoning / misrepresentation. This is easy to see when you can see the author’s response to her video.</description>

    <title>AI Alignment doesn&#039;t need more attention</title>
    <link>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/AI-Alignment-doesn't-need-more-attention</link>
    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/AI-Alignment-doesn't-need-more-attention</guid>
    <description>by Defender We know the correct solution to AI alignment has to be bottom up. We also know that you must answer the question “align to what?”. The final piece that isn’t yet widely accepted as far as I can tell is that you CANNOT align AI without aligning humans as well.</description>

    <title>Scissor Statement is a Scissor Statement?</title>

    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/Scissor-Statement-is-a-Scissor-Statement</guid>
    <description>I’ve been using the phrase “scissor statement” IRL, and some people can infer what it means, but most stop me and ask “wait, what is a scissor statement?” This strikes me as a useful litmus ...</description>

    <title>The Current Bottleneck to Coordination</title>

    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/The-Current-Bottleneck-to-Coordination</guid>
    <description>I think it’s theory. There is no “journal of coordination science”. We can’t peer review each other, no shared language exists1. We pretty much figured out most of the theory, but we haven’t peer reviewed each other.</description>

    <title>Why it hurts so much when others point out your flaws</title>

    <description>TODO: explain that it’s about because it calls into question your own awareness of yourself. If you did something rude, AND you weren’t aware it’s rude, then you are NOT in control.</description>

    <title>When to switch to a new paradigm?</title>
    <link>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/When-to-switch-to-a-new-paradigm</link>
    <guid>https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/When-to-switch-to-a-new-paradigm</guid>
    <description>There is no objective, rational answer to this question. Only switching when a new paradigm makes better predictions means you never develop new paradigms (heliocentrism made WORSE predictions of the motion of planets at the beginning, until accepted &amp; developed) It is unknowable whether a paradigm will bear fruit until you try it.</description>
