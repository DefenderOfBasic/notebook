I gotta be honest, I was expecting some complete pseudoscience bs from this. Just finished a first read-through and I’m blown away, and think that the author should immediately work with “credentialed” physicists to get this into the scientific mainstream (Nature paper).\nx.com/BenShindel/status/1912526687973126298\n\nBen debates here the best way to actually get the attention of mainstream physicists. Is a big nature paper enough? or a scientific magazine with high standards like Quanta?\n\nI think the stated goal of the author is to bring about a paradigm shift in physics. In order to do that you have to get mainstream physicists on board.\nx.com/BenShindel/status/1912526687973126298\n\nI think the Human Memeome Project will solve this kind of problem as a side effect.
