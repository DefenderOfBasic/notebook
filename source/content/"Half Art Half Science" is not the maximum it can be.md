When people say something is "half art" / "half science", to me that is a kind of scissor statement. It shows they have the wrong metaphor for understanding what these two things are & how they relate.

Something can be (1) not art, (2) art, or (3) great, profound, beautiful art.

Something can be (1) not science, (2) science, or (3) breakthrough, brilliant, useful science. 

These aren't on an axis of one to the other. They are two separate axes.
