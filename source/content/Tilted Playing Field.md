We live in a universe where the playing field is tilted towards GOODNESS, TRUTH, and BEAUTY.

- Truth is decentralized, lies require coordination 
- Those on the side of evil wish to hide this fact. They wish to control. 

I think the core idea is that there is something categorically different about GOOD and EVIL. If this is true, then you can exploit this difference to create asymmetric systems that tilt the playing field such that more good emerges. Understanding the nature of this difference is key.
