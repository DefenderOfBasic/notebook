The **side mirror blindspot sensor** warns you when a car is in your blindspot. It makes the decision FOR you (safe, or not safe to turn). If it fails, you have no way to know this. The "failed to detect" case is equivalent to the "it's safe to turn" case!

By contrast, the **rear view camera** solves the same problem in a much better way.
