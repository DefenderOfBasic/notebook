> - **You are a constellation of past experiences**, experiencing the present, assimilating it to act and prepare for future opportunities, creating the new You.
> - Consciousness is the consensus mechanism through which this constellation creates the next experience, which then becomes a part of the constellation.
> - **You feel, because it is only through this feeling that you emerge**
