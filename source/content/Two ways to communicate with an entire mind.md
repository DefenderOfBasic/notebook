(1) You either attention blast the entire network, so all nodes know about it, and then the relevant ones will respond (in the civilizational mind, that's going viral/mainstream media)

(2) You create an unbroken chain through the network. This has never happened before in humanity, at least not in my lifetime. Propaganda is EASILY defeated if you just know someone, firsthand. If it happens, coordination will be much easier. Our civilizational brain will "think much faster"

(hence, one outcome of the Human Memome Project is connected everyone, not literally every one to every other one, but each attention network should have at least ONE route to every other one. Like a minimal spanning tree)
