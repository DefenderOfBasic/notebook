I've been using the phrase "scissor statement" IRL, and some people can infer what it means, but most stop me and ask "wait, what is a scissor statement?"

This strikes me as a useful litmus test. But for what? For "being a normie"? That implies that most people on the internet know what a scissor statement is? I know that it's a LessWrong thing, but I feel like it's spread beyond that by now?
