Currently working on bootstrapping the [[‚≠êÔ∏è Open Research Institute]] which is a missing piece of infrastructure for civilization-wide coordination.

Also working on evangelizing "open memetics" / open source & decentralized cultural engineering. This is necessary for "steering the ship" towards the best possible future for all sentient beings. This is "universal alignment", AI alignment is a subset of this problem.

My background is in software engineering _(computer graphics / geospatial / game dev)_, and marketing / community management _(have been a maintainer of a large open source project, hosted hackathons/game jams etc)_.
