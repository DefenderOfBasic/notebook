A class that teaches you how to get the attention of notable people, through public correspondence (tweet replies/comments/essays). You pay only if it works

This is win win because, you only pay if it works, AND when it works, it doubles as good marketing for the class.

It's also scalable: it's NOT using cheap tricks to get attention. It's using techniques that, if you have good information, you get rewarded. If your information isn't useful, you get negative feedback. So, if EVERYONE followed this system, it would lead to a better information environment, _for everyone_.
