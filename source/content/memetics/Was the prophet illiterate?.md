- in Egypt they changed a fundamental truth about the prophet mohamed (that he actually was NOT illiterate)
	- it'd be like saying ACTUALLY BTW WE DISCOVERED JESUS WAS NOT A CARPTENER 
	- hijab wasn't a requirement in Islam a generation ago -> changed in the same way
- it's not done as a "new change", it's "always been this way"
	- Like: "there's a misconception, that jesus is a carptener, why do people believe that? it's silly! it's not true!! it's based on a false interpretation, the truth is he was a _____ "
- they're trying to get literacy rates up (which is good, I don't want open memetics to interfere with that)
