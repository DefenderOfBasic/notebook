There's a special dynamic that I think happens in all minds, when one neuron creates a global connection. I don't know what to call it yet. This was my path from being just a guy to very quickly reaching the frontier of human knowledge.

The way you do that is by asking questions that reveal the edge of your knowledge. If the answers exist, you find them. If the answers do not exist, you've found the edge of the egregore (your local unit of mind). 

Now the process repeats recursively: the egregore broadcasts the edge of its knowledge. Every time you find an answer, you broadcast it back down to the full network. You repeat this process until you've made the widest possible connections across the full network.
