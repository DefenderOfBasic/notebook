An egregore is a collective mind. It is bound together by shared attention, shared beliefs, and shared language. Its edges are fuzzy and evolving, but empirically measurable (using scissor statements?).

An individual mind can belong to one or more "nested" egregores. Some egregores are mutually exclusive, and one neuron (human mind) cannot belong to both (like pro capitalism vs anti capitalism).
