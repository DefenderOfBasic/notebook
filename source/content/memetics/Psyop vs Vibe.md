Compared to the word "vibe", which has a more organic pattern.

This doesn't necessarily mean that the word "psyop" was a psyop, just that _something happened_ that triggered everyone to talk about it all of a sudden. This is either a "known event" (like one significant person popularized it in this community, or an external piece of news), or an "unknown event" (which _could_ be a psyop).
