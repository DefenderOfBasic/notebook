Meta-memes, also known as "regulatory memes" are beliefs whose presence in a network changes the dynamics of how every other meme spreads. 

An example of a meta-meme is the belief that _"the individual is allowed to change the culture they are in"_ (see [[Brian Nosek on believing in culture change]]). The effect this has is faster mutation rate, and much higher rate of decentralized sources for change. 

Another example of a meta-meme is the belief that _"traditional wisdom supersedes novel insights"_ (more salient in specific Islamic cultures compared to the US). This has the effect of slowing down the rate of change & general stability. **In general, any meme that alters the host's epistemology is a meta-meme**. 

An example of something that is NOT a meta-meme is _"non-profits are better than corporations"_. This has various downstream effects but does not directly change the general memetic dynamics in a network.
