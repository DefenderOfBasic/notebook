The Open Memetics Institute is open to all, except dark memetics (TODO: explain that we can award someone as "the first ever person to do this thing in history", if you want to claim that you were the first, you have to step out of dark memetics into the open community. Otherwise, we won't bother you, but you can't claim we're not the first)
