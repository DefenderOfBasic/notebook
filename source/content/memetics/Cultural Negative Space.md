As hinted at in Michael's bio:

redJ (https://x.com/sudoredj) understands this concept too. Like, you can deduce the existence of hidden processes in a system by noticing this kind of consistent pressure/force pushing in a specific direction. 

An example of something that exists in this negative space is open memetics. It's such an obviously useful idea, but for some reason, no one has done it for a long time. You can study the forces holding that negative space in place, and work around them. 

#### What does it mean when you see an empty space in a semantic map of social media?

Like in a map like this: https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1908957396371997182

It could be:

- "edges of the overton window"
- "visualizing censorship" (centralized)
- "blasphemy" / stigma (same as above but decentralized)
- could just be gibberish / nonsense
