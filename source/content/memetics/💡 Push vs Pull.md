This is the fundamental principle of open memetics: we want ideas to spread via "pull", not via "push". 

If you expose someone to an idea, and they refuse to adopt it, this is valuable feedback. You may believe the idea is good for them, and maybe you are correct, but why don't _they_ see it too? This is a useful puzzle to solve. You either learn that actually, it's BAD for them, OR they misunderstood it, and now that you now that, you can spread it even faster. 

Spreading via "push" is easier if you have power/resources, but it is less stable. It degrades the hosts' epistemology, and you don't learn as much.

TODO: explain this principle of top-down pushing an idea (overriding internal resistance), vs "pull", presenting the idea, and if any resistance pops up, you resolve that. Creates "cleaner" integration and spread. Built in feedback
