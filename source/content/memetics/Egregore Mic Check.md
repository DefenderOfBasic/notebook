Up on stage in a crowded theater, you ask "does anyone have a blue Prius? It's blocking the driveway, please move it". The cultural version of this is to make a targeted statement and see if anyone from that egregore (1) can hear you (2) is willing to respond.

If you can talk about an egregore without anyone correcting you/responding, then they are "out of bounds".
