A population may appear informed if they know a lot of things, but may be epistemically illiterate (cannot discern truth on their own). There is no way to know someone's epistemic literacy from a snapshot, you must observe them gaining new knowledge.

If your audience is willing to believe misinformation that supports their cause, they may be illiterate. This is bad for *you* because you may make mistakes, and will have no feedback.
