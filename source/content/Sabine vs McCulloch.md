Sabine usually reviews things accurately and with high integrity. In this case she seems to have dismissed with poor reasoning / misrepresentation. This is easy to see when you can see the author's response to her video. But most people do not! 

(the ideal system would be one where, if I follow the author on twitter/bluesky/substack, and I'm on the youtube video, I see his response, like a community note)
