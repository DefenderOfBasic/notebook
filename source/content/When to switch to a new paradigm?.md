There is no objective, rational answer to this question. 

- Only switching when a new paradigm makes better predictions means you never develop new paradigms 
	- _(heliocentrism made WORSE predictions of the motion of planets at the beginning, until accepted & developed)_
- It is unknowable whether a paradigm will bear fruit until you try it. You don't know if you're 1-2 experiments away from a breakthrough, or if centuries of work will not produce anything 

The signal for whether you're close to a breakthrough or not is: intuition. Based on everything you know, does this FEEL like the right direction. This is what got us heliocentrism (it just felt more right, more beautiful, more correct, etc)
