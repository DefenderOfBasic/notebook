It has a fancy name, but it's really not that complicated. It's just literally asking "how do we know that?" for each thing you learn.

Example: dinosaurs 

- Q1: **How do we know they existed?** 
- A: We found these giant bones.

- Q2: **How do we know that they looked like giant lizards?**
- A: We made this best guess based on _\<whatever>_

Recording "how we know" allows you to cleanly remove pieces of knowledge from your world model without everything collapsing. 

So when it's found out that dinosaurs did NOT look like giant lizards, you don't say "well shit, if they were wrong about this, what ELSE are they wrong about?" and go through a crises of faith. You already knew it was just a guess, so it being updated isn't that surprising.
