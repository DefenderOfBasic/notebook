Opt-in to make your peer review public. If you say "this work is amazing, world changing", there are two possible outcomes:

- ✅ It really is, and you publicly declaring this helps it spread, and helps *you* 
	- _(signals you have foresight/called it early)_
- ❌ It is not, it actually has serious flaws, in which case it STILL helps you 
	- _(it hurts your reputation, but if your review was genuine, this is important feedback for you to know)_

This makes people want to be "early to endorse" groundbreaking stuff (first public reviewer, top 10 reviewers )
