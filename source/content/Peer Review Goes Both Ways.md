Opt-in to make your peer review public. If you say "this work is amazing, world changing", there are two possible outcomes:

- ✅ It really is, and you publicly declaring this helps it spread, and helps *you* 
	- _(signals you have foresight/called it early)_
- ❌ It is not, it actually has serious flaws, in which case it STILL helps you 
	- _(it hurts your reputation, but if your review was genuine, this is important feedback for you to know)_

This makes people want to be "early to endorse" groundbreaking stuff _(first public reviewer is known, first 10 public reviewers etc)_ 

Also makes it possible for undergrads (or anyone) to contribute. If everyone in your undergrad class thinks a paper is brilliant, then it goes to the professor, and he sees the flaws, then it's basically a test. If the undergrads (or internet randos) think it's bad, it could be because it's bad, or because they don't get it.

It simultaneously spreads knowledge, in both directions.
