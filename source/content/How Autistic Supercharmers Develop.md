# How Autistic Supercharmers Develop (1 / 2)

You find social interaction confusing, because the rules keep changing. Making a phone call to schedule an appointment is hard because you're trying to answer: **in what order do I need to give the information?** Do I blurt it all out at first? Do I say hi and wait for them to ask? 

It seems there is NO correct answer. Sometimes it's this, sometimes it's that

**The key you're missing is how to query the other human's emotional state**. The pattern isn't random, it is perfectly predictable given (1) your emotional state (2) their reaction to it. You cannot pre-plan this, because of what Wolfram describes as "computational irreducibility". You must learn the markov chain of: given (1) & (2), predict the next state.

So how does one develop this skill? 

You must let go of the comfort of pre-planned scripts. They are training wheels holding you back from learning the necessary skill.

All you have to do is (1) prompt a human AND (2) predict their response ahead of time. Almost like an LLM. Try to have a target response in mind, and think of what prompt would trigger that response. 

You can try this on the internet. Wade into any emotionally charged topic (like politics), ask someone an earnest question, notice how many things trigger an angry response. Keep trying (with different people) until you get an earnest response. There is a pattern to all humans. You can crack it. The patterns you find online translate to real life.
