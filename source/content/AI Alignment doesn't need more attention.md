We know the correct solution to AI alignment has to be bottom up. We also know that you must answer the question _"align to what?"_. The final piece that isn't yet widely accepted as far as I can tell is that **you CANNOT align AI without aligning humans as well**. 

So, what are we doing here? Who's working on the human alignment problem?
