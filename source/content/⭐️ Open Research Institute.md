The open research institute is where you write down weekly what you think is at the frontier of human knowledge, until you find it. That's the onboarding. 

You graduate when you contribute a novel piece (make a 90/10 prediction, as in, a prediction that most people get wrong, and you are in the minority that get it right) that's your degree.
