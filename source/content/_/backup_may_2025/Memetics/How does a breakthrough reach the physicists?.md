Once you find a breakthrough, how DOES it spread in society?

> Woah. I gotta be honest, I was expecting some complete pseudoscience bs from this. Just finished a first read-through and I'm blown away, and think that the author should immediately work with "credentialed" physicists to get this into the scientific mainstream (Nature paper).

Ben debates here the best way to actually get the attention of mainstream physicists. Is a big nature paper enough? or a scientific magazine with high standards like Quanta? 

> I think the stated goal of the author is to bring about a paradigm shift in physics. In order to do that you have to get mainstream physicists on board.

I think the **Human Memeome Project** will solve this kind of problem as a side effect. Answering the question of how DOES good information spread in the current networks? If you are outside the scene, and you found something important, how do you communicate it to insiders? 

Studying it has this reflexive property, by looking at where information bottlenecks are, our attention fixes them.
