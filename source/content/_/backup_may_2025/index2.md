title: Defender's Notebook

This is my open research notebook. I'm currently thinking a lot about consciousness, memetics, coordination, and philodosy (universal alignment / love pill / religion)

My background is in computer science & math. I worked in tech for 6 years (geospatial software). Used to make flash games on Newgrounds back in the day. 

Find my long form polished writing on Substack (https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/about). I'm also active on twitter (https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic).
