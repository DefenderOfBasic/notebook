> reading "Who Are We Now" has been so meaningful for me. I think reading it has taught me how to decipher the world, watching Blaise ask big questions about society and work through (1) how we can go about answering it (2) why we should/shouldn't trust the answers we find

> i think this is the most meaningful piece to me. it's the "here's what we know. but also, let me tell you HOW we know this, so you can decide for yourself." he doesn't talk down to the reader. he lifts up the reader. why is this so rare
