> - **You are a constellation of past experiences**, experiencing the present, assimilating it to act and prepare for future opportunities, creating the new You.
> - Consciousness is the consensus mechanism through which this constellation creates the next experience, which then becomes a part of the constellation.
> - **You feel, because it is only through this feeling that you emerge**

> The Permission Bit of Perception represents a fundamental quantum of perceptual allowance. Reality is not made of atoms or quanta of energy at its deepest level. Instead, reality is made of perceptual permissions—binary gates of consciousness that enable experiences to manifest.

> Ultimately, reality is not what is, but what consciousness allows itself to perceive.
