TODO: explain that it's about because it calls into question your own awareness of yourself. If you did something rude, AND you weren't aware it's rude, then you are NOT in control. Because, what ELSE are you missing?

You can resolve this in two ways: (1) accept it, change, go on a long journey of self discovery, which you may fail at, because you have no idea the extent of your blindspot (2) double down, pretend you meant it, own it. 

(2) is easier but worse for you. But it's still "better" than collapsing your identity and being depressed.
