_Announcement post: https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/open-memetics-journal-call-for-submissions_

Planet Money interviewed him here: [How to meddle in an election](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/24/726536757/episode-915-how-to-meddle-in-an-election). He wrote his own write up here: [Example of Experimental Memetics in the Wild: Memetics Deployed to Affect Voter Turnout in 2017 US Senate race in Alabama](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RifkCv8NpI1Yqf0ERxVse931kvksthDX/edit)
