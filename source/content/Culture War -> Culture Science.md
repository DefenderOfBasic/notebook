- If you really think the other side is evil, you MUST try to predict them. This is how you change them, or outcompete them
	- (you can't claim to be a good person and refuse to learn about your enemies, while they keep winning & the good guys despair)
- Every human has been part of a memetics study. It was either secret, or open & pro-social. If you're reading this, you're part of an open memetics study

### Memetic Tracing

Part of this would be a meme that traces itself as it spreads. We can do this WITHOUT mass surveillance. You don't know where it went, you don't need to know that. All you need to know is:

1. Where it came from, where you first heard it
2. Where you sent it, if any 

Each person linking back to where they heard it from, can then ask THAT person, and they'll share if they are within each other's trust network.

All you need is ONE "unbroken chain" across the entire network. Not all of humanity in one trust network, but ONE trust network that slices across humanity
