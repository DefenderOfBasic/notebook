- Get that scene from Andor
- The source of the truth matters 
- Also describe a real psyop that I saw?


-----

In Andor (star wars), there is a scene where two rebel groups turn on each other, they are stuck on a planet, there is only enough resources for one of them to survive

At some point, group A tells group B "you can't survive on these coconuts forever!!" -> this is true, AND causes despair within group B. 

This is a truth that hurts the enemy. The captain had not told them this truth, even though he knows it, because (1) he's working on a solution, just needs more time (2) there's nothing they can do about it, they trust him with their life. They trust that he will surface problems to them if they will be able to do something about it
