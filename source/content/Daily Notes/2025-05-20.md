Currently stuck in a really silly failure mode: 

- Lots of beautiful and exciting ideas flood my mind
- want to pursue each of them, fail to focus & ship anything -> 
	- feel bad because overwhelmed 
- push the beautiful things away, push myself to focus -> 
	- feel bad because joy disappears

Solution is easy in principle: figure out the correct balance, pursue the joy and follow it through. New beautiful ideas coming can be appreciated without being pursued?

Ok, I figured it out: how future historians will describe the age of what happened in 2020-2030, they spoke different languages. But they didn't realize it. And BECAUSE they didn't have a name for it, they didn't notice it fracturing.

the Open Memetics Institute has two departments: light & dark (the light one doesn't know where the dark one is, doesn't actually know if it exists. But, if it does exist, the light one will eventually catch up to the dark one)

(unless superorganism dies. Is this related to Ogi's thing? that humanity did not get math for a long time. That's weird. That's not normal. )
