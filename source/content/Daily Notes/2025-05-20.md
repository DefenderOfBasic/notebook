Currently stuck in a really silly failure mode: 

- Lots of beautiful and exciting ideas flood my mind
- want to pursue each of them, fail to focus & ship anything -> 
	- feel bad because overwhelmed 
- push the beautiful things away, push myself to focus -> 
	- feel bad because joy disappears

Solution is easy in principle: figure out the correct balance, pursue the joy and follow it through. New beautiful ideas coming can be appreciated without being pursued?
