Reviewing the live twitter semantic search in [[2025-05-22]]:

Would definitely use it if there was a page I can just type my queries into. Seems equally as useful as Exa's internet wide semantic search (Exa used to have twitter as one if its datasources, but was recently removed). Which is kind of annoying because like, you can still do the same thing but now you have to make a web app that calls both the Exa API & the twitter API.

I'm still very bullish on "bottom up recursive semantic search" as being the way forward. It's a REALLY hard problem to surface good information in a massive unfiltered dataset. But I've already filtered the information down through my trust network! I mostly care about searching within that network

(and once I know something is true, I often then will want to do the "internet wide" search to see who outside of my network has found it/expressed it, so I can find the truth seekers/those I can trust in other networks)
