### Answer


Here is a digest of world news from the last 24 hours, based on available information from recent web sources. Since the exact timestamp for "last 24 hours" depends on your current time, I’m focusing on the most recent developments reported up to May 22, 2025, as per the data provided. Note that some reports may be slightly older than 24 hours due to publication timing, but I’ve prioritized the freshest updates where possible. I’ve also included a note on limitations at the end.

### Key Global Developments (May 21-22, 2025):
1. **Israel-Gaza Conflict Escalation**:
   - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to "take control" of Gaza, prompting strong international backlash. Allies including the UK, France, and Canada have threatened "concrete" responses if Israel does not halt its renewed offensive and allow humanitarian aid into the region. They labeled the escalation as "egregious." (Source: The Guardian, published ~2 days ago, reflecting ongoing tensions).
   - Reports of Israeli strikes in Gaza continue, with medics stating at least 38 people were killed in a half-hour period by fighter jets targeting sites, including a school in Gaza City, as per the Hamas-run civil defense agency. (Source: BBC, published ~2 days ago but indicative of persistent conflict).
   - Additional posts on X mention an Israeli offensive killing 153 and injuring 459 amid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, though these figures are unverified and should be treated as anecdotal sentiment (Source: Posts on X, dated May 18-22, 2025).

2. **Ukraine-Russia War Updates**:
   - President Donald Trump appears to be stepping back from pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, leading many Ukrainians to brace for a prolonged conflict. (Source: The New York Times, published ~2 days ago).
   - Recent posts on X mention massive drone attacks in 11 Russian regions, with Moscow closing all airports, as well as Ukrainian forces reportedly destroying Russian aircraft and stopping assassination attempts. Additionally, there are unverified claims of failed peace talks and Russian drone attacks killing civilians. These reports lack independent confirmation and reflect social media sentiment rather than established fact. (Source: Posts on X, dated May 1-6, 2025, but relevant to ongoing war discussions).

3. **U.S. and Global Politics Under Trump Administration**:
   - President Trump’s Oval Office meetings have become a focal point, with world leaders facing public criticism during televised interactions, described as "smackdowns" by analysts. This marks a shift in diplomatic tone globally. (Source: CNN Politics, published ~9 hours ago, within the 24-hour window as of May 22, 2025).
   - Trump’s tariff policies are under scrutiny, with challenges in collection due to understaffed import agencies and exporters evading taxes. (Source: NPR, published ~2 days ago but relevant to current U.S. policy discussions).

4. **India-Pakistan Tensions**:
   - Reports of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan include a TRF-linked attack in Kashmir and artillery fire exchanges, as noted in recent social media updates. However, there are also mentions of potential de-escalation or agreements, though specifics remain unclear and unverified. (Source: Posts on X, dated May 18-22, 2025, treated as inconclusive sentiment).
   - Separately, China’s military technology reportedly gained a boost from involvement in India-Pakistan clashes, with success of Chinese-made jets and missiles fueling nationalist pride and warnings to Taiwan. (Source: The New York Times, published ~2 days ago).

5. **Other Notable Global Events**:
   - The Pentagon has reopened a probe into the 2021 Afghan withdrawal, signaling ongoing U.S. reflection on past military actions. (Source: Posts on X, dated May 21, 2025, unverified but noted as a point of discussion).
   - Israel is reportedly preparing potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, per U.S. intelligence cited in media, contributing to a spike in oil prices. (Source: Posts on X, dated May 21, 2025, treated as speculative until confirmed).
   - Mass protests in Mali against the military junta and a water crisis threatening Pakistan’s hydropower grid are among other regional concerns highlighted in online discussions. (Source: Posts on X, dated May 19-21, 2025, unverified).

### Limitations and Notes:
- The "last 24 hours" window is interpreted as up to May 22, 2025, based on the latest available data. However, some sourced articles (e.g., from May 19-20) are slightly older due to publication cycles but are included for context on ongoing stories.
- Information from posts on X is treated as supplementary and inconclusive, reflecting public sentiment rather than verified fact, especially for breaking or controversial topics.
- For the most precise updates within your specific 24-hour timeframe, I recommend checking live news outlets like VOA (Voice of America) or CNN, as they provide real-time coverage. (Source: VOA, updated ~2 hours ago as of May 22, 2025).
