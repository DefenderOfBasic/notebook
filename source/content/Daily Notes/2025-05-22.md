I couldn't find a way to try the live/free demo, seems you have to sign up for the API, buy some credits, and call it yourself. I ran it on a couple prompts & sharing it here for others to see.

### Summarize world news

This is the default example from the docs (https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/live-search)

> Provide me a digest of world news in the last 24 hour

You can see the full answer here: [[World Discourse]]. It seems like a good summary, nothing too surprising (mostly updates on Israel-Gaza, Ukraine, India-Pakistan).

### Summarize memetics news

The most useful thing I think would be being able to notice emerging "persistent" trends in specific subcultures or networks[^1]. 



[^1]: this would basically be like prompting an LLM from the future, since LLMs can approximate culture belief, but there's a time lag between when that belief takes hold in people's minds, and is reflected enough in the discourse for an LLM to pick it up in the next version
