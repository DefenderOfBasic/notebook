Just tell me what in the book you think I should know that I don't already know.

I get it, the book changed your life. That's often because it was your first exposure to the idea, not because this particular book is necessarily special. 

I won't gain anything if I already know it. OR, the idea may be "too far" up the cognitive ladder for me.
