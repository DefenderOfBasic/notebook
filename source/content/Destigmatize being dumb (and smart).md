Semantic embeddings show that our culture sees:

- ðŸŸ  **"smart"** as good, and **"dumb"** as evil 

But the gap should REALLY be closer to:

- ðŸŸ¢ "tall" & "short"

We can keep writing essays about this and checking the semantic embeddings of humanity to see if we've "moved the needle". This is open source cultural engineering.

> Destigmatize being intelligent too. People get so bent out of shape when you say something like "I'm a genius". If I were 7 ft tall they wouldn't demand we all pretend I'm not. Saying i'm smarter doesn't mean I'm better, but it does help when determining decision making.
